various fixes and changes
=========================

- cleanup code
  - remove duplicated code fragments, in particular
    - the burning backend, and
    - the burning dialogs
- implement progress dialog when adding files to composition 
- adding files to composition should be a new thread
- fix available writing speeds detection, and sort them [X]
- implement means to calculate available write speeds at the right moment
  (when the disk is inserted) - requires a lot of UI thinking 
- only allow usage of drives with matching capabilities
  - when burning ISO image, only show drives capable of 
    burning to desired disk, or report that we cannot
    burn the image if there is no capable drive
    (say somebody wants to burn DVD image on 
     a drive not capable of doing so)
  - when burning composition, only show drives capable of 
    burning desired composition, or report that we cannot
    burn the image if no capable drives are found, and
    leave all the files previously
    added by the user in composition so he could tweak it
- welcome tab that cannot be closed
- recode copy disk with libburn
- update columns resizing by using column enum index
- disable burn buttons before proper image file is selected
- take advantage of gvfs instead of thunar-vfs
- disable device selection before image is selected
  - once image is selected, populate device selection box
    only with appropriate devices (i.e. if it's 1200MB image,
    we can't burn it on cd-writer).
  - if no suitable writer is found, use that red label thingy
    to inform the user
