various fixes and changes
=========================

- cleanup code
  - remove duplicated code fragments, in particular
    - the burning backend, and
    - the burning dialogs
- implement progress dialog when adding files to composition 
- adding files to composition should be a new thread
- fix available writing speeds detection, and sort them
- popup dialog asking for disk to be inserted when one wants to 
  burn composition, copy disk or burn image so we can properly
  detect available speeds
- only allow usage of drives with matching capabilities
  - when burning ISO image, only show drives capable of 
    burning to desired disk, or report that we cannot
    burn the image if there is no capable drive
    (say somebody wants to burn DVD image on 
     a drive not capable of doing so)
  - when burning composition, only show drives capable of 
    burning desired composition, or report that we cannot
    burn the image if no capable drives are found, and
    leave all the files previously
    added by the user in composition so he could tweak it
- welcome tab that cannot be closed
- recode copy disk with libburn
