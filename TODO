various fixes and changes
=========================

- cleanup code
  - remove duplicated code fragments, in particular
    - the burning backend, and [started]
- implement progress dialog when adding files to composition 
  - adding files to composition should be a new thread
- fix available writing speeds detection (maybe task for libburn?)
- only allow usage of drives with matching capabilities
  - when burning ISO image, only show drives capable of 
    burning to desired disk, or report that we cannot
    burn the image if there is no capable drive
    (say somebody wants to burn DVD image on 
     a drive not capable of doing so)
  - when burning composition, only show drives capable of 
    burning desired composition, or report that we cannot
    burn the image if no capable drives are found, and
    leave all the files previously
    added by the user in composition so he could tweak it
- welcome tab
  - hide close button
- recode copy disk with libburn
- update columns resizing by using column enum index
- take advantage of gvfs in addition to thunar-vfs until thunar-vfs gets deprecated
- disable device selection before image is selected
  - once image is selected, populate device selection box
    only with appropriate devices (i.e. if it's 1200MB image,
    we can't burn it on cd-writer).
  - if no suitable writer is found, use that red label thingy
    to inform the user
- hide disc status in blank dialog
  - add refresh button and disable blank if invalid disc [?]
- unify code to add files (currently add button and dnd have separate 
    code bases) [?]
- determine if it's worth it to add advanced burn options dialog to 
  toggle rockridge and joliet extensions / iso_write_opts profiles
