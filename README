xfburn
------

Version 0.3.0, 2008-xx-xx

http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfburn/

An easy to use burning software for the xfce desktop environment (but of
course will work with others). It uses libburn and libisofs as a backend, in
difference to most other GUI programs at the moment. Visit
http://www.libburnia-project.org/ for more information about these libraries.

==============================================================================
Functionality
-------------

xfburn is still a new program, and does not yet do all common burning related
tasks.

Currently implemented is:
 * Create data compositions
  - Burn to CD or DVD
  - Create ISO images
 * Burn ISO images
 * Blank discs
 * Format and deformat DVD-RW discs

==============================================================================
Future Plans
------------

Missing functionality that we plan to add:
 * Save and load compositions
 * Verification
 * Burn audio CDs
 * Copy discs (needs backend support)
 * Automatic checksum creation
 * Blu-ray support
 * Plugin support

There is no, and never will be, a timeline for these. Let us know if you think
something is missing on this list. If you really need something implemented,
feel free to help us out :-).

==============================================================================
Bugs & Feedback
---------------

Any comments are welcome! We aim to make xfburn a very easily usable program.
So if you think something could be implemented differently, feel free to speak
up and it will be considered. Please send all feedbacks to xfburn@xfce.org, or
use the xfce mailing lists. Bugs are best placed in the xfce bugtracker at
http://bugzilla.xfce.org/
